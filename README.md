To set up both the server and the frontend, hereâ€™s a basic README.md template that covers the installation and startup process for both parts of the project.


You can adjust the file structure or commands based on your specific environment and technology stack.

Assigment 

This project includes both a server (backend) and a frontend. Below are the steps to install and start both parts of the applicationPrerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js/ReactJs (for the frontend)
npm or yarn (for managing frontend dependencies)
Python or any other backend language/runtime (if using a Python-based server)
Any required database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
Git (to clone the repository)



2. Backend (Server) Setup
Installation
Navigate to the server directory:

bash
Copy code
cd server
Install required dependencies. If you are using a Python server, you might use pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
If using another backend, follow the specific installation guide for that technology (e.g., npm install for Node.js, composer install for PHP).
